# Coding-Challenge-4
This assignment essentially asks us to add on to our previous coding challenge by implementing an EV class for electric vehicles. In this particular scenario we are including a Tesla that is starting at 120 km/h at a 23% charge. The steps we must take to do this is extending a new car class, implementing a chargeBattery method, and overriding the accelerate method. This project was great practice to learn more about coding with java script.
